- 👋 Hi, I’m @enamyaovi [you can call me Cephas too]

- 🌱 I’m currently learning back-end development with ALX Africa, transitioning from a background in mechanical engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in the future, but for now, I’m focused on building my skills and learning as much as I can.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me through my [LinkedIn profile](www.linkedin.com/in/cephas-tay-84aa6b212) or [email](cephas.tay137@gmail.com), both linked here.
